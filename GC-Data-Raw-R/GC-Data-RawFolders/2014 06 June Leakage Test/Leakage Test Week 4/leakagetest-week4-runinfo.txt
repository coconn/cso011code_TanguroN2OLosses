email subject line: Time 4 wk samples
[note that AU = autocrimped.  the non-AU samples were crimped with the hand crimper.]

See attached.  It is a day or two early but I had to run them now prior to the Holiday.

The run order is as before...

3 ea of M1, M2, 3N, 10N, 3KCO2
4 x amb
then immediately filed M1, M2, 3, 10 and 3K
followed by the AU samples of 3 ea as above
ending with 4 x amb AU

43 samples total.

Have a great 4th!
