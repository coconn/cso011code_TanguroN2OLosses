OK, I think I have the order down.  See attached.  3 each of M1, M2, 3, 10 and 3K, 4xamb, then M1, M2, 3, 10 and 3K filled and immediately ran.  Total of 24.  I'll stick with that order in the future unless you see otherwise.


Note that all of the vials were filled one day before this GC run (for calculations later of how many days have passed since preparation of the vials).
