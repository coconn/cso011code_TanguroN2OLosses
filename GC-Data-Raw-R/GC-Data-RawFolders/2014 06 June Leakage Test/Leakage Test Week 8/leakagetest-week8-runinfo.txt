email subject line: Time 8 gas flux
[note that AU = autocrimped.  the non-AU samples were crimped with the hand crimper.]

See attached for the week 8 gas flux values.  I used the same run order as week 1 for a total of 24.

Info about run order from previous:
"3 each of M1, M2, 3, 10 and 3K, 4xamb, then M1, M2, 3, 10 and 3K filled and immediately ran.  Total of 24."
