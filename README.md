# cso011code_TanguroN2OLosses: Info about this repo

## Introduction

This is a repo where I keep the raw data and the analytical codes for my trace gas work at Tanguro (2012-14).  Below is a quick rundown of the folders to think about.


### GC-Data-Raw-R folder

This is where the gas data lives and gets dealt with
* GC data gets processed here
* Flux data also gets calculated


### Sensitivity-Experiments

This is where analyses go that are checking on the quality of the data and methods.  Including:
* comparing gas samples that got run at UMN vs. those that were run at CENA
* the vial leakage test


### Soil-Data-Raw-R

This is where the soil data lives and gets dealt with


### TanguroN2OLosses-Analysis

This is where the magic happens
* Just kidding, but this *is* just where the actual paper analyses happen, since they cross the "gas data"/"soil data" boundary
* Including figures looking at data quality (those don't live in the gas data folder, for instance)


### Tanguro-MasterDataSheet.csv

This is the master data sheet, so it lives outside of all the folders because it runs my life
